        <p>
            this page outlines daedalus' privacy policy (how it collects and uses your data). this version is effective as of 2025-10-23. if you have any
            questions or concerns, please join the support server or email <a href="mailto:legal@daedalusbot.xyz">legal@daedalusbot.xyz</a>

        <h2>1. data provided by you</h2>
        <p>
            any information explicitly provided by you (configuration data) is collected indefinitely and retained for audit logging for your convenience (this
            information is not viewed by us unless necessary to resolve an issue reported to us by you)
        </p>
        <p>any information explicitly provided by usage of the service intended to be stored (e.g. moderation actions and notes) will be kept indefinitely</p>
        <h2>2. data required for functionality</h2>
        <p>
            certain modules will store information in the background as required to function, e.g. storing roles when a member leaves for sticky roles. this
            information is retained as long as is required for functionality
        </p>
        <h2>3. aggregate data</h2>
        <p>
            we will collect aggregate data in order to analyze usage patterns to provide the best experience possible for the service. this includes metrics
            such as usage rates and patterns of commands, trigger frequency of automated functionalities, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>4. removal of data</h2>
        <p>
            you may contact us through our support server to request complete removal of your or your server's data. note that not all data related to your
            account can be removed; for example, if your account has notes written by moderators in a server using daedalus, we cannot remove that data upon
            your request, but can upon the server owner's request
