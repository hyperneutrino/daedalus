            the teyvat collective network (TCN) is a collaborate of genshin impact "mains-style" servers dedicated to improving the genshin impact discord
            subcommunity through providing resources, promoting collaboration and positive relationships, and uniting communities
        </p>
        <p>
            the TCN is a high-quality but low-control network that has a selective induction process but does not require any more of its servers than to help
            promote the network and its partners and maintain a safe and healthy environment
        </p>
        <p>
            if you run a genshin impact character mains-style server and are interested in joining the TCN for access to collaboration opportunities,
            connections with othe server owners/admins, free access to daedalus custom clients, and more, check out their website for more information
        </p>
        <p>
            the TCN also has its own partners that are not directly affiliated with daedalus. this partnership was established by a majority vote from all TCN
            servers but without input from its external partners
        </p>
