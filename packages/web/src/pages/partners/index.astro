            the TCN is a network of high-quality genshin impact servers whose mission is to unite all mains servers across teyvat and provide support to and
            promote collaboration between partners
        </p>
        <p>
            daedalus started out in the genshin impact subcommunity and owes a large amount of its success to the space that has been supported by the TCN, as
            well as to direct word of mouth within the TCN and its affiliates
        </p>
        <p>
            this partnership helps both parties grow and provides mutual benefits &mdash; servers in the TCN gain access to the custom client feature, which is
            particularly well-suited to character servers as servers can run daedalus through a bot that takes on the appearance of their mascot characters
