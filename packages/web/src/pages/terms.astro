        <h2>2. security</h2>
        <p>
            you are responsible for the security of your discord account and managing access controls and permissions. there is little, if anything, that we can
            do if improper configuration of dashboard access permissions or command permissions results in people being able to compromise your server using
            daedalus
        </p>
        <p>
            we are responsible for ensuring that the dashboard is only accessible to people you specify and commands are only available based on the command
            permissions you configure, as well as implementing guardrails to avoid such incidents
