            this has all of the permissions required for all modules. you will need to give daedalus overrides for private channels and move daedalus' role
            above any roles you want it to manage

        <h2>install to server: admin</h2>
        <p>
            <b>this is not recommended!</b> you generally should avoid giving bots admin for security, but if you want to try out daedalus in a testing server or
            can't be bothered to learn permission setup, this is an option. remember to move daedalus' role above any roles you want it to manage, as admin does
            not override the role hierarchy
        </p>

            select the features you want to use and invite daedalus only with the necessary permissions. remember to move daedalus' role above any roles you
            want it to manage and give it any necessary overrides in private channels

        <h2>install to user</h2>
        <p>
            some utility commands can be used anywhere (even in servers without daedalus installed) if you install daedalus to your account, which does not give
            it access to any data you do not explicitly give it
